Form Styling Practice — Using CSS Pseudo-Classes

This mini project was about building a styled form and learning how to use CSS pseudo-classes to improve user experience and validation feedback.

What I practiced

- Creating a structured form with inputs, selects, textareas, fieldsets, and radio buttons
- Styling form elements for a cleaner UI
- Using pseudo-classes to react to user interaction

Key CSS pseudo-classes used

:hover
Used to change the button style when the user hovers over it.

:focus
Removes the default outline and makes inputs feel cleaner when selected.

:invalid and :valid
Provides visual feedback based on whether a field is filled out correctly.

:checked
Used to style radio buttons when they are selected (including highlighting labels).

What I learned

CSS pseudo-classes make forms more interactive without needing JavaScript.
They let you style elements based on user actions like hovering, focusing, typing valid data, or selecting a radio button.
