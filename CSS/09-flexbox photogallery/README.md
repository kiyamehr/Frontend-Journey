Flexbox Image Gallery

This project is a simple responsive image gallery built using CSS Flexbox.
The goal was to practice layout control, spacing, alignment, and wrapping with Flexbox while keeping the design clean and modern.

What I built

- A centered header section
- A fully responsive image gallery
- Smooth wrapping and spacing between images
- Consistent image sizing using object-fit

What I practiced

- Using flex-direction, flex-wrap, justify-content, align-items, and gap
- Creating a layout that adapts to different screen sizes
- Styling images with rounded corners and fixed height
- Using the ::after trick to keep the last row aligned

Key takeaway

Flexbox makes building responsive layouts way easier than using floats or manual positioning.
With just a few properties, you can control spacing, alignment, and responsiveness cleanly.
