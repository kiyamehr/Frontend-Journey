Playing Cards Layout

This project is a custom deck-of-cards layout built using HTML and CSS.
I recreated several playing cards using basic elements, Flexbox, and some simple transformations.

What I built

• A container holding multiple card components
• Individual cards with left, middle, and right sections
• Red and black suits using custom classes
• Upside-down symbols using CSS transform
• A responsive layout using Flexbox and wrapping

What I practiced

• Flexbox layout (row wrap, spacing, alignment)
• Positioning content inside a card using nested flex containers
• Using transform: scale(-1, -1) to flip elements
• Using custom classes to style red suits
• Creating consistent card dimensions and shadows

Key takeaway

You can build surprisingly complex card layouts using only HTML + CSS.
Flexbox makes it easy to align the card sections, and simple transforms can recreate real playing card designs.
