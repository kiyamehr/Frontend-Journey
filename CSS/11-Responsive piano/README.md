Responsive Piano Project

This project is a fully responsive piano interface built with HTML & CSS.
The main focus of this project was making a traditionally wide layout scale smoothly across different screen sizes.

What I Built

- A piano container with rounded edges

- White and black piano keys created using pure CSS

- A floating black-key effect using pseudo-elements

- A positioned logo inside the piano frame

Responsiveness

This project includes custom breakpoints to make the piano resize smoothly:

✔ Mobile (max-width: 768px)

- Piano width reduced

- Keys container resized

- Logo scaled down

Tablet (769px to 1199px)

- Intermediate sizes for piano and keys

- Keeps the layout centered and clean

✔ Desktop (1200px+)

- Full-size, original piano layout

💡 What I Learned

- Using @media queries to scale complex UI layouts

- Managing relative positioning with fixed elements

- Creating black keys using ::after pseudo-elements

- Preventing layout breaks with overflow: hidden and box-sizing techniques
