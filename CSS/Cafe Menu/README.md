Café Menu – HTML & CSS

This is a small project I built while learning HTML and CSS on freeCodeCamp.
It’s a simple café menu page that helped me practice basic tags, styling, and layout structure.

What I learned:

- Basic HTML structure

- Linking CSS files

- Using classes and simple selectors

- Styling text and layout
