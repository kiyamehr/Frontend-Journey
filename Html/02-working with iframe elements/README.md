What Is an <iframe>?

The <iframe> element lets you embed another webpage inside your webpage.
Think of it as a small window showing content from another site.

Example:
<iframe src="https://example.com" width="400" height="250"></iframe>

Common uses:

Embedding YouTube videos

Showing Google Maps

Displaying external pages or widgets

You can style the box (width, height, border),
but you cannot style or change the content inside the iframe,
because it comes from another website.

That’s it — simple and clean.
