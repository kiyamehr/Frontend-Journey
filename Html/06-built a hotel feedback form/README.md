This project is a small practice exercise where I learned how to work with different HTML form elements.
It includes:

- Radio inputs

- Checkboxes

- Select dropdown menus

- Textarea fields

- Labels and basic form structure

The goal of this project was to understand how each input type works, how they behave inside a form, and how to build a simple user-friendly UI.
