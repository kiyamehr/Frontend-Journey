HTML Tables Practice

This project is a simple exercise where I learned how to build and structure tables in HTML.

What I practiced:

- Creating a <table> with proper structure

- Using <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot>

- Adding rows and cells with <tr>, <th>, and <td>

- Using <caption> for accessibility

- Using colspan to merge table cells

- Displaying data in a clean, readable format
