# 📦 About This Folder

This folder contains **all the codes that Jonas teaches in his JavaScript course**, including both the **starter** and **final** versions for each section.

The folder structure is the same as the one Jonas provides in the course.
I’m only adding **my own code** inside the **starter** folders of each section.

## 📘 How I Use This Folder

* Each section has a **starter** folder (from Jonas)
* And a **final** folder (the completed code from the course)
* I add **my own solutions, practice files, and rewritten code** inside the starter folder
* This helps me follow the course properly and see how my code compares to the final version

## 🎯 Purpose

This folder simply exists to keep all the course material in one place
while also showing **my personal progress** as I work through the lessons.
