# Tailwind Lesson 02

This folder contains my experiments and lessons while learning **Tailwind CSS**. Here, I’m focusing on:

* Learning how to use **classes** and utilities effectively.
* Testing layouts, spacing, colors, and typography.
* Practicing small examples to understand how Tailwind works in a real project.
