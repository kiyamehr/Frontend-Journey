# Tailwind Lesson 3

This folder contains **Lesson 3** of my Tailwind CSS learning journey.

In this lesson, I focused on:

* Setting up a **responsive webpage** with Tailwind classes.
* Using **flexbox** for layout (`flex`, `flex-col-reverse`, `justify-between`, `items-center`).
* Implementing **sticky headers** and scroll behavior (`sticky`, `scroll-mt-*`).
* Styling elements for **light and dark mode** (`dark:` variants).
* Creating **cards and sections** with spacing, borders, shadows, and rounded corners.
* Practicing **responsive design** with Tailwind’s media query prefixes (`sm:`).

This project is a small webpage called **“Kiamehr Rockets”**, showcasing hero sections, cards for rockets, and placeholder sections for testimonials and contact.

And This Project is a Learning sample from **Dave Grey's** tailwind course.

It’s a hands-on exercise to reinforce **class-based styling, responsiveness, and dark mode** in Tailwind CSS.
